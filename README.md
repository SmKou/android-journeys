Android Journeys was originally an exercise in creating the android, or robot, using only css. On hover, it included the animations of an expanding head and a leg at an angle.

The animation of expanding the head was removed and the exercise was expanded into a gallery of scenes, where the robot changes color and size according to the image background. Javascript was used to keep track of images, their credit and sources, the color and size of the android.
